All txt format instances can be found in instances folder.

## Executable

You can just run the BiObjetive-pMedian-pDispersion.jar as follows.

```
java -jar BiObjetive-pMedian-pDispersion.jar
```

If you want new instances just replace folder instances.
Solution folder contains de pareto output per instances.
